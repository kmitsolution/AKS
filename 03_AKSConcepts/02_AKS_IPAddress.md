In Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), there are a few IP addresses associated with the cluster:

1. **Cluster IP**: AKS assigns a cluster IP address to each service within the Kubernetes cluster. This IP address is used for internal communication between services within the cluster. By default, services are only accessible from within the cluster.

2. **Node IP**: Each node in the AKS cluster has its own IP address. These node IPs are used for communication between nodes, as well as for accessing services that are exposed externally, if applicable.

3. **Public IP (optional)**: If you expose services externally, you may have a public IP address associated with your AKS cluster. This IP address is typically associated with a load balancer or an Ingress controller, allowing external traffic to reach your services.

4. **Control Plane IP**: The control plane of the AKS cluster, which includes components like the API server, etcd, and kube-controller-manager, has its own set of IP addresses. These IP addresses are managed by Azure and are not directly accessible from outside the cluster.

These IP addresses can be managed and configured based on your requirements. For example, you can configure services to be accessible only within the cluster, expose specific services externally with a public IP address, or use network policies to control traffic between different parts of your cluster.

When you create an AKS cluster, you can configure networking options such as whether to use Azure CNI (Container Network Interface) or Kubenet. These options affect how IP addresses are assigned and managed within the cluster.
