In Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), "node pools" refer to a set of nodes within a Kubernetes cluster that share the same configuration, such as VM size, disk type, and OS image. AKS supports two types of node pools: system node pools and user node pools.

1. **System Node Pool**:
   - The system node pool is a default pool created when you create an AKS cluster. It's primarily used to host system pods and critical Kubernetes components required for cluster operations, such as kube-proxy, kube-dns, and coredns.
   - System node pools are managed by AKS and are generally not intended for running user workloads.
   - You cannot directly add or remove nodes from the system node pool. AKS automatically scales the system node pool based on the cluster's requirements.

2. **User Node Pool**:
   - User node pools are additional node pools that you can create within an AKS cluster.
   - User node pools are intended for running your own application workloads. You have more control over these node pools, including the ability to scale them manually or automatically based on workload demands.
   - You can configure the VM size, node count, and other properties for user node pools based on your application requirements.
   - User node pools allow you to segregate different types of workloads, control resource allocation more finely, and isolate applications for better manageability and security.

In summary, system node pools are managed by AKS and primarily used for system-level components, while user node pools are customizable and intended for running your own application workloads.
