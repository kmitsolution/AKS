In Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), when you create a cluster, you have the option to choose a network plugin that defines how networking is implemented within the cluster. One of the network plugins available in AKS is the "kubenet" plugin.

Pod to Pod communication happens through 
The "kubenet" network plugin in AKS implements basic networking functionality directly through the Kubernetes kubelet. It doesn't require any underlying Azure virtual network (VNet) integration or network policies provided by Azure's native networking solutions. Instead, it sets up a simple network overlay using the Linux bridge and NAT (Network Address Translation) mechanisms on each node.

Key points about the "kubenet" network plugin in AKS:

1. **Simplicity**: The "kubenet" plugin is straightforward to set up and doesn't require additional configuration of Azure virtual networks. It's suitable for simple Kubernetes networking requirements.

2. **Isolation**: Each pod in the cluster gets its own IP address, and the pods can communicate with each other using these IP addresses.

3. **Limitations**: While "kubenet" is easy to set up, it may lack advanced networking features such as network policies and integration with Azure Virtual Networks (VNets). This may limit its suitability for more complex networking requirements or scenarios where strict network isolation or advanced networking features are needed.

4. **Performance**: In terms of performance, "kubenet" may have some overhead compared to more optimized network plugins like Azure CNI (Container Network Interface). However, for many common workloads, the performance impact may not be significant.

5. **Cost**: Since "kubenet" doesn't require Azure VNet integration, it may have lower associated costs compared to other network plugins that utilize Azure's networking resources more extensively.

In summary, the "kubenet" network plugin in AKS provides a simple and easy-to-use networking solution suitable for basic Kubernetes deployments without advanced networking requirements. However, for more complex scenarios, such as those requiring network policies or tighter integration with Azure networking features, other network plugins like Azure CNI may be more appropriate.
