To create an Azure Pipeline for building a Docker image from a Dockerfile and pushing it to a container registry, follow these steps:

1. **Create an ASP.NET Core Project**: Create your ASP.NET Core project, and add the Dockerfile as described in your second step.

2. **Add Code to Azure Webapp Repo**: Commit the ASP.NET Core project along with the Dockerfile to your Azure Webapp repository.

```Dockerfile
# Use the .NET 6.0 SDK image to build the application
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:6.0 AS build

# Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the project file and restore dependencies
COPY WebApp.csproj .
RUN dotnet restore

# Copy the remaining source code
COPY . .

# Build the application
RUN dotnet build -c Release -o /app/build

# Publish the application
FROM build AS publish
RUN dotnet publish -c Release -o /app/publish

# Use the .NET 6.0 ASP.NET runtime image for the final image
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:6.0 AS final
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=publish /app/publish .
ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "WebApp.dll"]

```   

4. **Create Azure Pipeline**: Go to your Azure DevOps project, navigate to Pipelines, and create a new pipeline. Choose "Azure Repos Git" as the source of your code and select the repository where you added your code.

5. **Select Docker File for Container Registry**: When prompted to select a template for your pipeline, choose "Docker" and then "Container registry".

6. **Update Azure Pipeline Code**: Replace the default pipeline YAML code with the code you provided in step 5. Make sure to update the values of variables like `dockerRegistryServiceConnection`, `imageRepository`, `containerRegistry`, `dockerfilePath`, and `tag` according to your setup.
```yaml
# Docker
# Build and push an image to Azure Container Registry
# https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/languages/docker

trigger:
- master

resources:
- repo: self

variables:
  # Container registry service connection established during pipeline creation
  dockerRegistryServiceConnection: 'cf03d43e-24aa-4180-8ec9-24ecfac9c93c'
  imageRepository: 'webappnew'
  containerRegistry: 'myreg322.azurecr.io'
  dockerfilePath: '$(Build.SourcesDirectory)/WebApp/Dockerfile'
  tag: '$(Build.BuildId)'

  # Agent VM image name
  vmImageName: 'ubuntu-latest'

stages:
- stage: Build
  displayName: Build and push stage
  jobs:
  - job: Build
    displayName: Build
    pool:
      vmImage: $(vmImageName)
    steps:
    - task: Docker@2
      displayName: Build and push an image to container registry
      inputs:
        command: buildAndPush
        repository: $(imageRepository)
        dockerfile: $(dockerfilePath)
        containerRegistry: $(dockerRegistryServiceConnection)
        tags: |
          $(tag)

   ```

8. **Commit Changes**: Commit the changes to your Azure DevOps repository.

9. **Run the Pipeline**: Trigger the pipeline manually or let it run automatically based on your configured triggers.

10. **Check Container Registry**: Once the pipeline has completed successfully, navigate to your Azure Container Registry (`myreg322.azurecr.io` in your case) and verify that the `webappnew` image with the specified tag (e.g., `webappnew:<BuildId>`) is present.

By following these steps, you should be able to create an Azure Pipeline that builds your Docker image from the Dockerfile and pushes it to the specified container registry.
